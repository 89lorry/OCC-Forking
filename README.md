# Fork a Repository
##  Forking a repository on platforms like GitHub is a common practice in open-source development. 

```bash
#Look for the "Fork" button usually located at the top-right corner of the page. Click on it.
#This action will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

#Depending on the size of the repository and the platform's load, forking might take a few seconds to complete.
#You'll be redirected to your forked repository once it's done.
